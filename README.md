🧠 Hi there, I’m Abu Tahim Habiby! 👋

AI & Data Science Enthusiast | Machine Learning Researcher | CSE Undergraduate @ DIU (Class of 2025)

🧩 About Me

I’m a passionate Computer Science and Engineering student at Daffodil International University, driven by curiosity about how data and intelligence shape the future.
My academic and research journey focuses on Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Data Science (DS) — particularly their applications in healthcare and agriculture.

I’ve co-authored multiple research papers in AI-driven diagnostics and data analytics, exploring hybrid CNN architectures, ensemble learning, and explainable AI (XAI).
Beyond research, I enjoy building interpretable, scalable systems that blend AI innovation with real-world impact.
